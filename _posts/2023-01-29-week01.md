title: Week 1: Something about Open Source
---

When I first heard the term "open source", I thought those are projects that everyone could access, modify, and contribute to the source code to make them more comprehensive and perfect. Since open source projects are used and supported by a larger scale of developers and normal users, different application scenarios often result in bugs being found and fixed quickly, and diverse requirements drive more rapid innovation compared with close source projects. Besides that, for normal users, open source projects usually mean free of charge.

I did not realize that I have been using open source projects for a long time until I understand what open source is. For example, [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) has helped me a lot in learning, whether it is more convenient for me to understand a professional term, or to quickly build a specific impression of something. Besides that, I've been using [Android](https://www.android.com/) devices for nearly 10 year, and have experienced how they grew from simple and unstable to excellent. These improvements are due to the continuous maintenance and innovation of developers. Moreover, I also installed [MicroG](https://microg.org/) on my phone to replace Google Mobile Services (GMS). 

However, there're still some disadvantages. Some open source projects may not be user friendly, and some provide accurate documents or user guides. I have experienced with this during my internship. At that time I tried to use [BigDL](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL)'s Keras-style API to build and run a neural network on cloud. However, the inaccuate documentation forced me to dig into the source code to determine whether those functions exist or not.

Since I have benefited a lot from open source projects, and also experienced some of the disadvantages, I joined this class out of interest, and also in hope of becoming a qualified contributor to give back and improve the community.
